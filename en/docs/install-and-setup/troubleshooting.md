To enable debugging in WSO2 Open Banking, you have to configure product observability in WSO2 Identity Server and WSO2 API 
Manager. Product observability enables rapid debugging for you to process and eliminate product issues.

!!!note
    By default, product observability is not enabled as it impacts the product's performance.
