## What is an open banking accelerator?

An open banking accelerator provides the base technology for financial institutions to meet open banking compliance. 
It accelerates open banking adoption by providing the required technology stack to cater to open banking requirements 
so that you don't have to build a solution from scratch. This can accelerate your pathway of reaching defined goals in 
open banking compliance, technology, and business goals.
